# DISCO: A Large Scale Human Annotated Corpus for Disfluency Correction in Indo-European Languages

Abstract: Disfluency correction (DC) is a vital post-processing step applied to automatic speech recognition outputs, before subsequent processing by downstream language understanding tasks. Existing DC research has primarily focused on English due to the unavailability of large-scale open-source datasets. Towards the goal of multilingual disfluency correction, we present a high-quality human-annotated DC corpus spanning four different Indo-European languages- English, Hindi, German and French. We provide extensive analysis of state-of-the-art DC models across all four languages obtaining F1 scores between 92.97 and 97.55. To show the benefits of DC on downstream tasks, we show that DC leads to a significant 5.65 points increase in BLEU scores on average when used in conjunction with a state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) system. Our code and datasets will be released publicly upon publication.
